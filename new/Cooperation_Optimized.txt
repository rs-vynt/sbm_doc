===============================================

PARTNERSHIP MINDSET (10-YEAR VISION)
------------------------------------
We aim to build a long-term, stable and trusted partnership with LSMK during the full 10 years of the contract.
The cooperation models below are not limitations. They help both sides identify what structure fits LSMK’s vision,
development plan and priorities for SBM.

Goal:
- Build a stable, scalable, high‑quality SBM system
- Ensure continuity, transparency, and long-term collaboration
- Choose a cooperation model that supports Phase 2 and future phases

------------------------------------
0.1. COOPERATION MODELS (TO DISCUSS)
------------------------------------

OPTION 1: PROJECT-BASED MODEL (Like Phase 1)
--------------------------------------------
Scope:
- Work on SBM projects only (Phase 2, Phase 3, ...)
- Clear scope, budget, timeline for each project
- Payment per milestone or completion

Structure:
- Fixed cost + bonus (like Phase 1)
- Or milestone-based pricing
- Ends when project completes
- Flexible timeline

Pros:
- Clear scope & cost
- Easy project management
- Flexible (can choose projects)
- Good if focusing only on SBM
- Timeline flexibility

Cons:
- Communication gaps between phases
- No long-term commitment
- Less continuity

Best if:
- LSMK only focuses on SBM
- Fixed budgets per phase
- Flexible timeline requirements

--------------------------------------------

OPTION 2: RETAINER / PARTNERSHIP MODEL
--------------------------------------------
Scope:
- Ongoing SBM development & maintenance
- Can also include other LSMK projects
- Priority support and ongoing improvements

Structure:
- Monthly retainer (base commitment)
- Additional project costs for big features
- VN team acts as “extended development team”
- Guaranteed minimum hours
- Flexible schedule

Pros:
- Stability & long-term commitment
- Better communication (regular sync)
- Faster response & continuity
- Deeper understanding of product
- Can handle multiple LSMK projects
- Stable budget for LSMK

Cons:
- Monthly cost
- Requires mutual commitment

Best if:
- Long-term collaboration
- Frequent support needs
- Multiple projects besides SBM
- Need a technical partner

--------------------------------------------

OPTION 3: LONG-TERM POSSIBILITY ONLY (Discuss Only If CEO Requests)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
This option is *not* for Phase 2.
It is only a long‑term possibility (6–18 months),
discussed only if LSMK is interested in expanding development activities in Vietnam.

We will NOT go into detail unless Dr. Song requests.

Scope:
- A dedicated Vietnam development team/company for LSMK
- Handle all LSMK projects (SBM + others)
- Possible outsourcing to other companies (if approved by LSMK)
- Expand team when needed

Structure:
- Investment or structured partnership by LSMK
- Monthly budget or revenue sharing model
- Higher scalability and long-term setup

Notes:
- Requires full-time commitment in the future
- Requires legal & management planning
- Not relevant for Phase 2 discussion unless CEO specifically asks

Transition Path (only if CEO is interested):
Phase 1 → Retainer Model (Option 2)
Phase 2 → Higher commitment
Phase 3 → Dedicated VN team/company

---------------------------------------------
